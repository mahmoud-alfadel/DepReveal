1651,2021-03-12T22:58:56.714Z,2021-03-12T22:59:36.198Z,,Prototype Poisoning,msgpack5,['CVE-2021-21368'],<3.6.1||>=4.0.0 <4.5.1||>=5.0.0 <5.2.1,>=5.2.1||>=4.5.1 < 5.0.0||>=3.6.1 <4.0.0,"### Impact

When `msgpack5` decodes a map containing a  key `""__proto__""`, it assigns the decoded value to `__proto__`. As you  are no doubt aware, `Object.prototype.__proto__` is an accessor  property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to the key `__proto__` decodes to an object or `null`, `msgpack5` sets  the decoded object's prototype to that value. 

An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example `length`, numeric properties, and `push` et al if `__proto__`'s value decodes to an `Array`); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for example if the `__proto__` value decodes to a `Map` or `Date`). Other unexpected behavior might be produced for other types. 

There is no effect on the global prototype.

An example: 

```js 
const msgpack5 = require('msgpack5')(); 

const payload = {}; 
Object.defineProperty(payload, '__proto__', { 
value: new Map().set(1, 2), 
enumerable: true 
}); 

const encoded = msgpack5.encode(payload); 
console.log(encoded); // <Buffer 81 a9 5f 5f 70 72 6f 74 6f 5f 5f 81 01 02> 

const decoded = msgpack5.decode(encoded); 

// decoded's prototype has been overwritten 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded)); // Map(1) { 1 => 2 } 
console.log(decoded.get); // [Function: get] 

// decoded appears to most common typechecks to be a Map 
console.log(decoded instanceof Map); // true 
console.log(decoded.toString()); // [object Map] 
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(decoded)); // [object Map] 
console.log(decoded.constructor.name); // Map 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded).constructor.name); // Map 

// decoded is not, however, a Map 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(decoded) === Map.prototype); // false 

// using decoded as though it were a Map throws 
try { 
decoded.get(1); 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.get called 
// on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 
try { 
decoded.size; 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method get Map.prototype.size 
// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 

// re-encoding the decoded value throws 
try { 
msgpack5.encode(decoded); 
} catch (error) { 
console.log(error); // TypeError: Method Map.prototype.entries 
// called on incompatible receiver #<Map> 
} 
``` 

This ""prototype poisoning"" is sort of a very limited inversion of a 
prototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is 
affected, and it can only be set to `msgpack5` values (though if the 
victim makes use of custom codecs, anything could be a `msgpack5` 
value). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype 
pollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code).

`urijs` before version 1.19.6 is affected by hostname spoofing issue.

If using `urijs` to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character as part of the scheme delimiter, e.g. `scheme:/\hostname`. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.

Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

Implementations using the Prisma database adapter that are not using the Email provider are not impacted.
Implementations using the default database adapter (TypeORM) with the Email provider are not impacted.
Implementations not using a database are not impacted.

### Description

The Prisma database adapter was checking the verification token but not the identifier (the email address associated with the token). This made it possible to use a valid token assigned to one user, to sign in as another user when using the Prima adapter in conjunction with the Email provider. The defect is specific to the community-supported Prisma database adapter in versions <3.3.0 and is not present in the default database adapter (TypeORM).

*Note:  The current community-supported adapter was not developed by Prisma.*

The defect was a problem in the implementation of verification function the adapter and is not directly related to Prisma.

The flaw may exist in other third party database adapters that do not check both the identifier and token values.

The design of the database adapter API may be revised in future to help reduce the likelyhood of similar defects.",Upgrade to version 3.3.0 or later,"- [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pg53-56cg-4m8q)

### Impact

If you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input you are potentially impacted.

The security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a `.constructor.constructor` technique.

* If running `angular-expressions` in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)`.
* If running `angular-expressions` on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround might be either to : 

* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into `angular-expressions` in your application

OR

* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput : 

```js
if (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :""'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {
      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);

### Impact

When processing theming resources (i.e. `*.less` files) with less-openui5 that originate from an untrusted source, those resources might contain JavaScript code which will be executed in the context of the build process.

While this is a [feature](http://lesscss.org/usage/#less-options-enable-inline-javascript-deprecated-) of the [Less.js library](https://github.com/less/less.js), it is an unexpected behavior in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development.

Especially in the context of [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), which relies on less-openui5, this poses a security threat:

An attacker might create a [library](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Builder/#library) or [theme-library](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Builder/#theme-library) containing a custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript code in one of the `.less` files.

This is an example of inline JavaScript in a Less file:
```less
.rule {
	@var: `(function(){console.log('Hello from JavaScript'); process.exit(1);})()`;
	color: @var;
}
```

Starting with Less.js version 3.0.0, the Inline JavaScript feature is disabled by default. less-openui5 however currently uses [a fork](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/tree/master/lib/thirdparty/less) of Less.js v1.6.3.

Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still evaluates code has additional double codes around it:
```less
.rule {
	@var: ""`(function(){console.log('Hello from JavaScript'); process.exit(1);})()`"";
	color: @var;
}
```

### Patches

We decided to remove the inline JavaScript evaluation feature completely from the code of our Less.js fork.

This fix is available in less-openui5 version [v0.10.0](https://github.com/SAP/less-openui5/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version.

project contain an information disclosure flaw, leaking options to the
NATS server; for one package, this includes TLS private credentials.

The connection configuration options in these JavaScript-based
implementations were fully serialized and sent to the server in the
client's CONNECT message, immediately after TLS establishment.

The nats.js client supports Mutual TLS and the credentials for the TLS
client key are included in the connection configuration options;
disclosure of the client's TLS private key to the server has been
observed.

Most authentication mechanisms are handled after connection, instead of
as part of connection, so other authentication mechanisms are
unaffected.
For clarity: NATS account NKey authentication is NOT affected.

Neither the nats.ws nor the nats.deno clients support Mutual TLS: the
affected versions listed below are those where the logic flaw is
present. We are including the nats.ws and nats.deno versions out of an
abundance of caution, as library maintainers, but rate as minimal the
likelihood of applications leaking sensitive data.

Affected versions:

Impact:

key material for TLS is leaked from the client application to the

client application also disables TLS verification (and so the true
identity of the server is unverifiable) then authentication credentials

The `saml2-js` library may incorrectly utilize the results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic signature, allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication to SAML service providers.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based markup language for security assertions regarding authentication and permissions, most commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) services.

Some XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs may be inconsistent in handling of comments within XML nodes. Incorrect use of these APIs by some SAML libraries results in incorrect parsing of the inner text of XML nodes such that any inner text after the comment is lost prior to cryptographically signing the SAML message. Text after the comment therefore has no impact on the signature on the SAML message.

A remote attacker can modify SAML content for a SAML service provider without invalidating the cryptographic signature, which may allow attackers to bypass primary authentication for the affected SAML service provider","If you use 1.x upgrade to version 1.12.4 or greater

An attacker is able to craft a request that results in an `HTTP 301` (redirect) to an entirely different domain. 

A request for: `http://some.server.com//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` would result in a 301 to `//nodesecurity.org/%2e%2e` which most browsers treat as a proper redirect as `//` is translated into the current schema being used.

Mitigating factor: 

In order for this to work, `st` must be serving from the root of a server (`/`) rather than the typical sub directory (`/static/`) and the redirect URL will end with some form of URL encoded `..` (""%2e%2e"", ""%2e."", "".%2e"").

```
var st = require('st')

There are two specific scenarios in which it is likely for an application to be vulnerable:
1. The application executes unsafe, user-supplied sql which contains malicious column names.
2. The application connects to an untrusted database and executes a query returning results which contain a malicious column name.

## Proof of Concept
```
const { Client } = require('pg')
const client = new Client()
client.connect()

const sql = `SELECT 1 AS ""\\'/*"", 2 AS ""\\'*/\n + console.log(process.env)] = null;\n//""`

client.query(sql, (err, res) => {
  client.end()

And the request is intercepted and tampered as follows:
```
X-Payment-Source: dst@money.com // Emails switched
X-Payment-Destination: src@money.com
Authorization: Signature keyId=""Test"",algorithm=""rsa-sha256"",headers=""x-payment-destination x-payment-source"" MDyO5tSvin5...

## Mitigating Factors

This is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. 

The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided, because at that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.","Update to version 0.12.7 or later.

As this vulnerability is primarily a user error, the patch for the vulnerability will simply cause the application to write an error message to the console when a vulnerable configuration is used in a production environment.

Writing a proper CORS configuration is still the responsibility of the user, so it is necessary to check for the error message after installing the patch. Be sure you are not using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'`, and that you uncomment `origin` and set it to a reasonable value. Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.

Likewise, ensure `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value. Make sure to explicitly set which origins may request resources via CORS.","- [Sails Documentation - CORS Configuration](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-cors)

Bash has a neat but not well known feature known as ""Bash Brace Expansion"", wherein a sub-command can be executed without spaces by running it between a set of `{}` and using the `,` instead of ` ` to seperate arguments.

This flaw exists because link URIs containing HTML entities get processed in an abnormal manner. Any HTML Entities get parsed on a best-effort basis and included in the resulting link, while if that parsing fails that character is omitted.

If you have a user model that you want to protect, such as the following User model:
```
const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    password: String,
}));
```

You would normally do something such as:
```
restify.serve(router, User, {
    private: ['password'], // Set the password part of User as private, so outside people can't read it
})
```

This would hide the password field from people that send your application a `GET /User` and `GET /User/some-user-id` request. 

A malicious user can go to your application and send a request for `GET /User?distinct=password` and get all the passwords for all the users in the database, despite the field being set to private.

This may result in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.


## Proof of Concept
The xss() function removes the word ""javascript"" when contained inside an attribute.

However, it does not properly handle cases where characters have been hex-encoded. 

As a result, it is possible to build an input that bypasses the filter but which the browser will accept as valid JavaScript.

For example:
```<a href=""jav&#x61;script:..."">abc</a>```
will render as:
```<a href=""javascript:..."">abc</a>```","The package author has decided to remove the xss filter functionality in the latest version of this module. If this feature is not currently being used, you are not affected by the vulnerability. If it is being used, updating to the latest version of the module will break your application.

## Proof of Concept
Various inputs that could bypass the filter were discovered:

Improper parsing of nested tags:

```
<s <onmouseover=""alert(1)""> <;s onmouseover=""alert(1)"">This is a test</s>
```

Incomplete filtering of javascript: URIs:

```
<a href=""javascriptJ a V a S c R iPt::alert(1)"" ""<s>"">test</a>
```

UI Redressing:

```
<div style=""z-index: 9999999; background-color: green; width: 100%; height: 100%"">
<h1>You have won</h1>Please click the link and enter your login details:
<a href=""http://example.com/"">http://good.com</a>
</div>
```

Bypass via Nested Forbidden Strings:

```
<scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt type=""text/javascript"">prompt(1);</scrRedirecRedirect 302t 302ipt>
```

Additional bypasses were discovered by Krzysztof Kotowicz in 2012 when auditing CodeIgniter's XSS filtering function, which this code was based off of.","If you are a developer currently using the xss filter function from the validator package, you should consider replacing it with the escape filter function from the same package. This function replaces all instances of angle brackets (<, >), ampersands, and quotation marks, so no HTML tags will be processed.","- [XSS Filter Bypass in validator Node.js Module](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2013/07/xss-filter-bypass-in-validator-nodejs-module/)

The vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the password for the admin service, no matter how complex that password is, in less than 200 requests.


## Details
The tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an `access_key` in the config options. This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.


Tomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location. This allows an attacker to provide a single character as an `access_key`, and so long as the server key contains at least one instance of that character it will be considered a valid key.

## Proof of Concept
This is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.

```
if (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {
```

For an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.

```
$ curl -X POST ""http://localhost:8081/api/exec"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d @test -H ""access-key: a""

MongoDB Connector for LoopBack fails to properly sanitize a filter passed to query the database by allowing the dangerous `$where` property to be passed to the MongoDB Driver.

This is an [intended feature of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/) unless disabled ([instructions here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/#disable-server-side-js)).

A proof of concept malicious query:

For the application to be impacted by this vulnerability it must meet all of these conditions

- Runs on Electron 1.7, 1.8, or a 2.0.0-beta
- Allows execution of arbitrary remote code
- Disables Node.js integration
- Does not explicitly declare webviewTag: false in its webPreferences
- Does not enable the nativeWindowOption option
- Does not intercept new-window events and manually override event.newGuest without using the supplied options tag","Update to `electron` version 1.7.13, 1.8.4, or 2.0.0.beta.5 or later

If you are unable to update your Electron version can mitigate the vulnerability with the following code.

```
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, win) => {
  win.on('new-window', (event, newURL, frameName, disposition,
                        options, additionalFeatures) => {

    options.webPreferences.nodeIntegrationInWorker = false;
    options.webPreferences.webviewTag = false;
    delete options.webPreferences.preload;

// and *IF* you don't use WebViews at all,
// you might also want
