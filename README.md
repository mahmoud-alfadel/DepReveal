A Command-Line tool to analyze the discoverability of npm dependency vulnerabilities through the entire history of your GitHub project.


CONCEPT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The workflow of the tool goes as follows:

* Fetch the history of the package.json file.
* Resolve dependency versions.
* Identify and classify the discoverability levels of vulnerable dependency versions (based on the approach in our [study](Anon.)).
* Generates a CSV file that contains the analysis, and HTML file that visualizes the results.


INSTALLATION
-----------------------
The tool is developed and tested mainly on GNU/Linux and Mac platforms. Thus it is very likely it will work out of the box
on any Linux-like and Mac platforms upon providing the right requirements and version of Python.

**To install**, simply run:
```
pip3 install git+"https://github.com/mahmoud-alfadel/XXX"
```

USAGE
-----------
To understand the commands used by the tool, please run the following:
```
dependency_threat --help
```

EXAMPLE
-----------
To help you use the tool, we show below an example of running the tool on a popular Node.js project called Wiki.js. We assume that the tool is already installed. We use the following command to run the tool:
```
dependency_threat -o report.csv https://github.com/Requarks/wiki
```
The previous command uses the two arguments:
* The first argument (optional) is the name & path of the output CSV file. By default, it will save in your current folder.
* The second argument (required) is the URL of the project GitHub repository.


TOOL OUTPUT
-----------
The tool generates two files: 
* CSV file that contains all the details of dependencies discoverability levels along with their meta-data for the entire project lifetime (by days).
* HTML file that illustrates some analytical plots for the discoverability levels of vulnerable dependencies. The HTML file is generated by default even if the output CSV file argument is not set. The HTML file contains 3 main plots:
    - **GitHub Contirbution Graph**: this plot shows the history of Dependency Discoverability Levels, where each cell represents a day in the project lifetime, and it is coloured according to the highest discoverabiloity level of dependencies used at that day in the project.

    - **BarsPlot**: this plot shows a distribution of project dependnecies across the Discoverability Levels for each day in the project lifetime. The plot is interactive where the user can zoom in/out, enable/disable one of the levels apper on the legeneds at the right-side of the plot, etc., using the configuration bar available at the top right-side corner of the plot.

    - **Word Cloud**: this plot shows the distribution of vulnerable packages that cause discoverability levels for the entire project lifetime.
A snapshot of the generated HTML report for the Wiki.js project can be seen below:
