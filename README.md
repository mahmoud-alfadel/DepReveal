A Web-UI & Command-Line tool to analyze the discoverability of npm dependency vulnerabilities throughout the entire history of a GitHub project.

CONCEPT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The workflow of the tool goes as follows:

* Fetch the history of the package.json file.
* Resolve dependency versions.
* Identify and classify the discoverability levels of vulnerable dependency versions (based on the approach in our study.
* Generates a CSV file that contains the analysis and HTML file that visualizes the results.


INSTALLATION
-----------------------
The command-lin version of the tool is developed and tested mainly on GNU/Linux and Mac platforms. Thus it is very likely it will work out of the box
on any Linux-like and Mac platforms upon providing the right requirements and version of Python.

**To install**, simply run:
```
pip3 install git+"https://github.com/mahmoud-alfadel/DependencyReveal/"
```

USAGE
-----------
To understand the commands used by the tool, please run the following:
```
dependency_reveal --help
```

EXAMPLE
-----------
To help you use the tool, we show below an example of running the tool on a popular Node.js project called React-native from Facebook. We assume that the tool is already installed. We use the following command to run the tool:
```
dependency_reveal -o report.csv https://github.com/facebook/react-native
```
The previous command uses the two arguments:
* The first argument (optional) is the name & path of the output CSV file. By default, it will save in the current folder.
* The second argument (required) is the URL of the project GitHub repository.


TOOL OUTPUT
-----------
The tool generates two files: 
* CSV file that contains all the details of dependencies discoverability levels along with their meta-data for the entire project lifetime (by days).
* HTML file that illustrates some analytical plots for the discoverability levels of vulnerable dependencies. The HTML file is generated by default even if the output CSV file argument is not set. The HTML file contains 3 main plots:
    - **Dependency Discoverability Graph**: it shows the historical exposure of the application to npm dependency vulnerabilities.

    - **Discoverability Levels Frequency**: it shows the frequency of dependency vulnerabilities per discoverability level. Using the configuration bar available at the top right-side corner of the plot. The plot is interactive where the user can zoom in/out, enable/disable one of the levels that appear on the legeneds at the right-side of the plot,

    - **Period of Package Exposition (in days)**: it show the period of time in which a vulnerable package had been affecting the application, per discoverability level. Users can also enable/disable one of the discoverability levels by clicking on the legends at the right-side of the report plot.
    - **Package Versions Discoverability**: it shows what package versions account for the project dependency vulnerabilities.

A snapshot of the generated HTML report for the React-native project can be seen in this [screenshot](https://bit.ly/3xkUxZk)).

The Web-UI version
-----------
We provide a Web-UI for the tool to facilitate its usage. A snapshot of the Web-UI can be seen below:
